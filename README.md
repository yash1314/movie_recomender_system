# Movie_Recommender_System
This is a Movie Recommender system which can recommend movies based on user input.

## Technology used:
- python, pandas, numpy
- sklearn, vectorizer
- cosine distance similarity
- streamlit
- tmdb API

## Movie Recommender method:
- Vectorization is a process of converting text data into numerical vectors, such as TF-IDF or word embeddings, allowing mathematical operations on text. Cosine similarity is a distance metric that measures the similarity between two text vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them, with a higher value indicating greater similarity, making it useful for text matching, recommendation systems, and clustering.
